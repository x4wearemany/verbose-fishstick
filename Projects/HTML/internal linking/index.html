              Before we get started here there are a few things we recommend you
              have ready
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>A computer/server machine capable of virtualization</li>
              <li>A USB Thumb drive</li>
              <li>A Laptop/PC to make a "bootable" USB stick</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3 id="about" class="h3">What you'll learn</h3>
            <p>
              How to make a "bootable" USB and install an operating system

            <h3 id="t1" class="h3">Setup</h3>
            <p>
              To get started you'll need to go to the
              <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads" target="_blank"
                >Proxmox website</a
              >
              and download the latest version of Proxmox. While you're at it
              download your selected thumb drive flasher and open it. <br />
              Once opened insert your USB thumb drive into your computer and
              select the Proxmox ISO image and start the flash.<br />
              When it finishes unplug your thumb drive and insert it into the
              computer you'll be using to make your Virtual Environment and turn
              it on booting into the boot menu and select the USB thumb drive.
              <br />
              There may be additional setup required in your system BIOS to get
              your virtualization working, We do not cover that in this article.

            <h3 id="t2" class="h3">Installation and Your first VM</h3>
            <p>
              Once in the install screen its pretty self explanatory, go through
              the graphical installation and while you go through if you have a
              FQDN don't forget to assign that in the correct screen. (i did my
              first time) <br />
              If you don't have a FQDN feel free to leave it as default, and
              remember to set the ip as something that isn't already used. Also
              set your password as something memorable <br /><br />
              Once install is complete it will reboot and go into its "terminal"
              and will show you the ip and port to put in to get to the local
              web interface. It will look something like this
              "https://192.168.0.20:8006"<br />
              Paste that into your browser and you'll be at the local web
              interface, once there input your username (root) and your chosen
              password (in the Realm it is Linux PAM <b>NOT</b> Proxmox VE) When
              you're finally logged in we recommend you set up a ZFS Share, to
              do so you will click your Node and click the disks drop down menu
              and click ZFS, click Create: ZFS and select the disk(s) you want
              in that partition <br /><br />
              Next you will need to upload another ISO image to your server and
              that is super easy. In the far left with the drop down menu for
              your node you'll see something labeled "local (node)" click on
              that <br />
              There will be another vertical menu with 5 options, click on "ISO
              Images" with the disk icon, click upload and select file. Select
              the ISO you want to use and upload it by hitting the "open"
              button<br /><br />
              Once that is uploaded you can make your first VM! To make one all
              you have to do is click the blue button in the top right corner of
              the screen that's labeled "Create VM" with a monitor icon <br />
              Put in the name of the VM, i'll go with "Lorem-ipsum" for shits
              and giggles. Click next and select the drop down ISO image menu
              and select the ISO you want to use (i recommend Ubuntu server) and
              click next<br />
              For the system tab i don't recommend you adjust anything so just
              click next again. For the tutorial we recommend you stick with
              32GB, just make sure it's on the correct storage you made <br />
              For the CPU tab it depends on your system, you can find the amount
              of CPUs you have in the node summary as well as the amount of ram
              you have. For mine i have a 2 sockets with 12 cores per CPU. For
              the tutorial we will go with 1 Socket and 6 cores. In the memory
              tab you can leave it at the default for our use-case, click next
              and ignore the network tab for now and click next again. The
              Confirm tab is an overview of your settings just so you can double
              check them before creating the VM. If all looks in order click the
              "Finish" button and it'll create the VM <br />
              All that is left to do is to start your VM, click on the newly
              created vm and select the "Console" tab, click the power button on
              the left hand side and select "Start" and your VM will start right
              up <br /><br />
              <b>CONGRATULATIONS!!!</b> You just created your very first VM!
              Thank you for reading and following this article and have a
              blessed day.
